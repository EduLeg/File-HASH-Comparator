# File-HASH-Comparator

Compare two file hashes using SHA256 algorithm. 

This project consists of testing the use of SHA256 algorithm to create file hashes and comparing against themselves to identify of the file is the same. 
1.	Use this by submitting a different or same file on both inputs, and watch the HASH be shown on the top. 
2.	Automatically compare the hashes by clicking the compare button and watch if the file HASH is the same as the other.
